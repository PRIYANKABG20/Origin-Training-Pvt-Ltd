It was very effective and therefore I would definitely be interested in attending other classes in the same format. The instructor was very knowlegeable and provided a wealth of information about the current version, especially since the last version I used was several releases ago."

The facility was very professional and there were no problems with connectivity. Our instructor was an expert and was very clear in his method of teaching.
